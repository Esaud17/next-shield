# Test it!

Play with it! Change the `isAuth` prop and you'll be automatically redirected to your public or private routes. Also you'll notice:

- 🤯 `0` flashy content!
- 🤟 You have all setup in one place!
- 😎 Avoid to write repetitive code like: `router.push(route)` after a sign in or sign out operations, delegate.
- 🥳 You don't need to write code to handle public or private routes anymore!
